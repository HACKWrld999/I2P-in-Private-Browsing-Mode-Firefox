i2psetproxy.js
==============

WebExtension that automatically sets up a browser to use the proxy into i2p.
This extension shouldn't be used on it's own, and the extension it should be
used with aren't quite done yet. In conjunction with a hardened user.js or
installed in a TBB, it's probably pretty safe. It doesn't contain any
fingerprintable resources.

Features
--------

  * [done] **Set** the http proxy to use the local i2p proxy
  * [done] **Disable** risky webRTC features
  * [done] **Change** the color of the browser window to indicate that i2p is in use
