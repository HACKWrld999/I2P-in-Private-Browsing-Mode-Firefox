<h1>Acknowledgement</h1>

<p><strong>Many, many thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/transmitter">Transmitter</a>
webextension.</strong></p>

<p>This part of this plugin contains code which was adapted from the Transmitter
webextension, which is a minimal interface to the transmission-rpc interfaces of
many torrent clients, including for our purposes snark-rpc and BiglyBT.</p>

<p>Transmitter is released under the UNLICENSE. An original copy is available at
this URL: https://github.com/myfreeweb/transmitter/blob/master/UNLICENSE</p>

<p>A copy has also been included in this directory.</p>

<h2>Configuring this extension for use with Snark-RPC!</h2>

<p>One of the coolest things this extension is able to do is communicate with
a transmission-rpc enabled torrent client. Since it's an I2P focused plugin,
the default configuration is set up for use with the I2PSnark-RPC plugin created
by zzz. Since Snark-RPC isn't part of the main Java I2P distribution, in order
to do this you'll have to install the plugin. You can get a copy of it from
inside of I2P here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stats.i2p/i2p/plugins/i2psnark-rpc.su3">stats.i2p main package</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stats.i2p/i2p/plugins/i2psnark-rpc-update.su3">stats.i2p update package</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a mirror of the package with each release of the webextension,
reflecting the version in use in the webextension at the time of the release.</p>

<p>To install the plugin, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/configplugins">http://127.0.0.1:7657/configplugins</a>
and scroll down to the section of the page where it says "Installation from URL"
and paste the following URL:</p>

<p><code>http://stats.i2p/i2p/plugins/i2psnark-rpc.su3</code></p>

<p>Click the "Install Plugin" button and you'll be ready to go. Now, open the
extension options menu, and just click "Save." The defaults are correct for use
with I2PSnark-RPC, but they need to be initialized by saving the settings. If
I2PSnark-RPC becomes part of Java I2P, these defaults will be initialized when
the plugin is installed.</p>
