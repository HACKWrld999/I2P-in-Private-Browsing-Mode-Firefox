      This is an webextension which introduces a set of new &ldquo;Private Browsing&rdquo; modes
      to Firefox-based browsers(Supporting webextensions, must be current ESR or
      greater) that makes it easier to configure a browser to use I2P securely and
      adds features for making I2P applications easier to use. It does this by
      isolating I2P-specific settings to Contextual Identities within Firefox, then
      loading them automatically when the user requests them. It also adds convenience
      and management features, like an embedded I2P console and Bittorrent integration
      with clients using the transmission-rpc API and via in-browser protocol handling
      integrations.

    <h2>
      Installation(Cross-Platform):
    </h2>
    <p>
      For desktop users this addon is available from addons.mozilla.org, where you
      will be able to recive automatic updates:
      <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i2p-in-private-browsing/">
        I2P in Private Browsing
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <h3>
      Setting the Homepage
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first time you run the extension, Firefox will offer you the option of setting
      your homepage and new tab page to the homepage contained
      <em>
        within
      </em>
      the extension. You
      can decline this or edit it later and it will not affect your anonymity. Enabling
      this feature allows the extension to set your homepage to a local document with a
      number of useful I2P links.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Debian Installation:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Should you prefer, it is possible to install this extension system-wide by
      side-loading it into Debian. You can generate your own deb file by running the
      command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>    make deb
</code></pre>
    <p>
      and then you can install it with:
    </p>
    <pre><code>    sudo apt install ../i2psetproxy.js_*.deb
</code></pre>
    <h2>
      Bittorrent Download:
    </h2>
    <p>
      The self-hosted plugin is available from bittorrent both within the I2P and
      Clearnet Bittorrent network(With a web seed to support it in case one goes
      dead).

    <h2>
      Usage:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Basically, it &ldquo;Just Works.&rdquo; After you install the plugin, browsing to an I2P
        domain will automatically stop the current tab and re-open the I2P site in an
        I2P Browser tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Besides that, four bookmarks are added to the &ldquo;Bookmarks Toolbar,&rdquo; which
        will take you to visit your Java I2P applications, or the &ldquo;Simplified I2P
        Landing Page&rdquo; embedded in the plugin:
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="lander.png" alt="Landing page" />
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, there&rsquo;s a menu for accessing I2P functionality while you&rsquo;re browsing.
        It lets you control a few settings in a granular way.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="menu.png" alt="Menu" />
      </li>
      <li>
        You can re-enable WebRTC but force it to always use the proxy that is
        enforced by the tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can either force the browser to delete all history for I2P sites
        immediately, or you can close all your I2P Browser tabs at once and delete
        the history for I2P browsing when you&rsquo;re done.
      </li>
      <li>
        That&rsquo;s all there is to it! Your browser is configured to safely use and
        administer I2P.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally, you can add I2PSnark-RPC and use Bittorrent-over-I2P via the
        transmission-rpc interface. To do this, have a look at the torrent guide:
        <a href="torrent/README.md">

        traffic by contextual identity to it&rsquo;s own HTTP
        Proxy tunnel, each reflecting it&rsquo;s own pseudonymous identity within I2P. The
        contextual identities. For now, the contextual identities used to manage
        browsing are &ldquo;I2P Browsing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Web Browsing&rdquo; where I2P Browsing is capable
        of using an outproxy but in the case of traffic destined for the clearnet
        does not do header rewriting, and Web Browsing falls back to the Proxy
        configured in Firefox. The I2P Browsing will be expanded to
        <ul>
          <li>
            I2P Amnesiac Browsing: Use for General Browsing, stores no history and
            uses an HTTP Proxy with a very short tunnel-close timeout and no key-reuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            I2P Social Networking: Use this for logging into social network accounts,
            forums, and other interactive asynchronous public communication platforms
            where your identity is behaviorally linkable. This has a very long
            tunnel-close timeout and key-reuse until specifically invoked.

          <li>
            I2P Blogging: Use this for posting content to the web interface of your
